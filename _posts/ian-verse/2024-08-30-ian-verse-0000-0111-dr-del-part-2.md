Blue popped the manhole at the street of ShalS and looked around.

Nobody is there. 

There aren't really any people here.

It's a forbidden area for regulars.

"We have to be quick," Blue whispered to NK. 

NK nodded.

Blue flipped the cover open jump like a cat on the street surface, reached out their hands to NK and pulled them up. 

"you need to light up a little"

NK looked at their 8B body and didn't say a word.

Yeah not sure why but at their birth they are super big compared to their peers.

As NK squished their bodies along the walls of the Shals, there were remote flashing lights and occasional police sirens near the entrance of the PMT tunnel. 

The reporters are gone after a full day of reporting and no development. 

Blue went below the yellow warning tape and checked around. 
"safe!"

Both NK and blue look at the crime scene in front of them.

How to describe it. The tunnel is full of garbage.

If they decay you won't be able to hold your breath there long.

Luckily those are all digital wastes.

It's just blocking the way, and continuously there will be more stuff created and then some stuff will be removed, yeah disappearing.

This usually happens when some programs are done with their job and are a good citizen to clean up after them.

But there are tons of wastes left behind. 

On the ground, there is a big white circle.

Yeah the circle they just learned in the class.
