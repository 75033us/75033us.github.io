"tick-tock" the clock is quietly running on the nightstand.

NK suddenly sat-up at their bed, and started running around the room looking for doors.

The light turned on suddenly.

"What's up Nwon?

Do you have nightmares?"

Mom opened the bedroom door and turned on the light

"You are screaming!"

Daddy come hold

holding NK in their arms firmly

"You are safe.

We are here.

Wake up, wake up Nwon!"

NK slowly calmed down

their eyes opened, but not focused

Eventually NK's eyes started to focus

looked at mom and then looked at dad

"mom? dad?"

"You are awake. You are safe"

"What happened?" Daddy is still holding NK in their arms.

Mommy sits on the edge of NK's bed

rubbing NK's large head

and wiping away NK's cold sweat

"I am scared" NK whispered

"I am scared"

"What are you afraid of?" Daddy asked?

"I don't know. I don't remember" NK cannot remember what caused the nightmare, but NK knows they are scared.
