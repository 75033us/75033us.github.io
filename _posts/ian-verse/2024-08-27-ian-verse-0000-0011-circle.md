Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. -- Moses

From that moment on

Nwon-knu doesn't use or mention this capability anymore

Nwon-knu thought everybody can do it

It's no big deal

> 从那一刻起

> Nwon-knu 不再使用或提及这种能力

> Nwon-knu 认为每个人都能做到这一点

> 这根本不算什么大事

"Who knows what a circle is?" Ret-sam asked

"I know, I know, a circle is a round shape" Another kid with long blue hair answered enthusiastically

"Then, can you tell me what's round"? Ret-sam followed-up

"Round is round, it's like my head" the blue hair pointed to their own head, the class break into laughters

> 「谁知道什么是圆？」Ret-sam 问道
>
> 「我知道 我知道 圆是圆的」另一个长着蓝色头发的孩子兴奋地回答
>
> 「那么 你能告诉我什么是圆的吗？」Ret-sam 接着问
>
> 「圆就是圆 就像我的头一样」蓝发孩子指着自己的头 班上立刻爆发出笑声

Well, how to describe it, there is actually so such thing as "shape" in Ian's world

They are digital beings

In their world, everything is composed of 0s and 1s

Or I should say sequence of 0s and 1s

It's very hard to "shape" a sequence

"You mean, imaging in your head?" Ret-sam continued

"Ok, let's dream! Close your eyes"

"Imaging you have a long sequence of 0s, say 81 of them"

"And, all the 0s are very obedient. They stay in their queue, and properly lined up"

"Now, you divide the long line into 9 equal sections, 9 each"

"Imaging, you pivots the 9 short sequences into a two dimensional array"

"It has 9 rows, and 9 elements each, got it?"

> 「你是说 在脑海中想像吗？」Ret-sam 继续问

> 「好吧 让我们来做个梦！闭上你的眼睛

> 想像一下你有一个长长的 0 序列 假设有 81 个 0

The class is super quiet.

All the kids closed their eyes, and started dreaming.

For some reason, their thoughts are projected on top of their mind.

Whatever they are imagining, are floating there.

> 所有的孩子们都闭上眼睛 开始做梦

You can see some snake shaped sequences

You can see some uneven short lines of elements floating around

You can see mixed of 0s and 1s instead of all 0s

It's total chaos

> 你可以看到一些蛇形的序列

> 可以看到一些不规则的短线元素在周围漂浮

> 可以看到混合的 0 和 1 而不是全是 0

> 这简直是一片混乱

But Ret-sam is waiting patiently

Until all the kids tried, maybe only 10% of them got it.

Nwon-knu is one of them.

> 直到所有孩子都尝试过

> 也许只有 10% 的孩子明白了

"Ok, open your eyes, and look at me," Ret-sam said and closed their eyes.

A floating image coming out of Ret-sam's mind.

It's a perfect line of 81 0s, one after another

Then the 81 0s divided into 9 rows, 9 0s each

It's like this:

> 「好吧，睁开眼睛，看着我！」Ret-sam 说道 随后闭上了眼睛
>
> 一幅浮现出来的画面从 Ret-sam 的脑海中出现
>
> 那是一条完美的 81 个 0 的线 紧紧相连
>
> 然后 这 81 个 0 被分成 9 行 每行 9 个 0
>
> 看起来像这样

"Tell what, a circle is a 2 dimensional shape"

"So, row is one dimension, and column is another dimension"

"Now, look at it carefully, I am going to draw a dot in the middle of this two dimensional space"

1 appeared in the middle

"As you can see, the 1 is at the center of this space, right"

"Right!" kids echoed in excitement.

They have never been able to "imagine" or "dream" of such a thing before.

It's a pure concept.

Even though their eyes can see each other, they cannot see shapes.

They can only imagine.

But they can see other one's imaginations!

"A circle is a shape
where all 1s are in equal length to the center"
As Ret-sam imagined, the following image appeared

"But it's not as round as my head," The blue hair complained.

"You are right, it's not, since our resolution is too low," Ret-sam nodded.

"Resolution?" the class is lost

"Sorry, resolution is also a new concept to all yall, I mean the number of elements."

"Today, we only used 9x9. Tried to increase it to 99x99, or 999x999"

"That's the homework for today, go home and imaging the circle as round as possible by increasing the resolution"

"Tomorrow we will talk about some special characteristics of the circle, and the introduction of the sphere."

"Class dismissed" Ret-sam declared the end of the class as the school bell started the tone:

> 「不过这圆形并没有我头的圆」蓝发孩子抱怨道
>
> 「你说得对 的确如此 因为我们的解析度太低了 」Ret-sam 点头
>
> 「解析度？」班上的孩子们感到困惑
>
> 「抱歉 解析度对你们来说也是一个新概念 我是指元素的数量
>
> 今天 我们只用了 9x9 试着把它提高到 99x99 或 999x999
>
> 这就是今天的作业 回家好好想像这个圆形 尽可能地使它圆 增加解析度
>
> 明天我们将讨论圆的某些特殊特征 以及球体的介绍
>
> 下课了」Ret-sam 宣布课程结束 随着校铃开始响起
