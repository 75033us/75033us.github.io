Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. -- Moses

From that moment on

Nwon-knu doesn't use or mention this capability anymore

Nwon-knu thought everybody can do it

It's no big deal

> 從那一刻起

> Nwon-knu 不再使用或提及這種能力

> Nwon-knu 認為每個人都能做到這一點

> 這根本不算什麼大事

"Who knows what a circle is?" Ret-sam asked

"I know, I know, a circle is a round shape" Another kid with long blue hair answered enthusiastically

"Then, can you tell me what's round"? Ret-sam followed-up

"Round is round, it's like my head" the blue hair pointed to their own head, the class break into laughters

> 「誰知道什麼是圓？」Ret-sam 問道
>
> 「我知道 我知道 圓是圓的」另一個長著藍色頭髮的孩子興奮地回答
>
> 「那 你能告訴我什麼是圓的嗎？」Ret-sam 接著問
>
> 「圓就​​是圓 就像我的頭一樣」藍髮小孩指著自己的頭 班上立刻爆發出笑聲

Well, how to describe it, there is actually so such thing as "shape" in Ian's world

They are digital beings

In their world, everything is composed of 0s and 1s

Or I should say sequence of 0s and 1s

It's very hard to "shape" a sequence

"You mean, imaging in your head?" Ret-sam continued

"Ok, let's dream! Close your eyes"

"Imaging you have a long sequence of 0s, say 81 of them"

"And, all the 0s are very obedient. They stay in their queue, and properly lined up"

"Now, you divide the long line into 9 equal sections, 9 each"

"Imaging, you pivots the 9 short sequences into a two dimensional array"

"It has 9 rows, and 9 elements each, got it?"

> 「你是說 在腦海中想像嗎？」Ret-sam 繼續問

> 「好吧 讓我們來做個夢！閉上你的眼睛

The class is super quiet.

All the kids closed their eyes, and started dreaming.

For some reason, their thoughts are projected on top of their mind.

Whatever they are imagining, are floating there.

> 所有的孩子都閉上眼睛 開始做夢

> 無論他們在想像什麼

You can see some snake shaped sequences

You can see some uneven short lines of elements floating around

You can see mixed of 0s and 1s instead of all 0s

It's total chaos

> 你可以看到一些蛇形的序列
>
> 可以看到一些不规则的短线元素在周围漂浮
>
> 可以看到混合的 0 和 1 而不是全是 0

> 这简直是一片混乱

But Ret-sam is waiting patiently

Until all the kids tried, maybe only 10% of them got it.

Nwon-knu is one of them.

> 直到所有孩子都嘗試過

"Ok, open your eyes, and look at me," Ret-sam said and closed their eyes.

A floating image coming out of Ret-sam's mind.

It's a perfect line of 81 0s, one after another

Then the 81 0s divided into 9 rows, 9 0s each

It's like this:

> 「好吧，睜開眼睛，看著我！」Ret-sam 說 隨後閉上了眼睛
>
> 一幅浮現出來的畫面從 Ret-sam 的腦海中出現
>
> 那是一條完美的 81 個 0 的線 緊緊相連
>
> 然後 這 81 個 0 被分成 9 行 每行 9 個 0
>
> 看起來像這樣

"Tell what, a circle is a 2 dimensional shape"

"So, row is one dimension, and column is another dimension"

"Now, look at it carefully, I am going to draw a dot in the middle of this two dimensional space"

1 appeared in the middle

> 1 便出現在中間

"As you can see, the 1 is at the center of this space, right"

"Right!" kids echoed in excitement.

They have never been able to "imagine" or "dream" of such a thing before.

It's a pure concept.

Even though their eyes can see each other, they cannot see shapes.

They can only imagine.

But they can see other one's imaginations!

"A circle is a shape
where all 1s are in equal length to the center"
As Ret-sam imagined, the following image appeared

> 其中所有的 1 都與中心的 1 距離相等」

> 接下來的圖像出現了

"But it's not as round as my head," The blue hair complained.

"You are right, it's not, since our resolution is too low," Ret-sam nodded.

"Resolution?" the class is lost

"Sorry, resolution is also a new concept to all yall, I mean the number of elements."

"Today, we only used 9x9. Tried to increase it to 99x99, or 999x999"

"That's the homework for today, go home and imaging the circle as round as possible by increasing the resolution"

"Tomorrow we will talk about some special characteristics of the circle, and the introduction of the sphere."

"Class dismissed" Ret-sam declared the end of the class as the school bell started the tone:

> 「不過這圓形並沒有我頭的圓」藍髮小孩抱怨道
>
> 「你說得對 的確如此 因為我們的解析度太低了 」Ret-sam 點頭
>
> 「解析度？」班上的孩子感到困惑
>
> 「抱歉 解析度對你們來說也是一個新概念 我是指元素的數量
>
> 今天 我們只用了 9x9 試著把它提高到 99x99 或 999x999
>
> 這就是今天的作業 回家好好想像這個圓形 盡可能地使它圓 增加解析度
>
> 明天我們將討論圓的某些特殊特徵 以及球體的介紹
>
> 下課了」Ret-sam 宣布課程結束 隨著校鈴開始響起
