Sorry, back to the geometry class.
Today is the first day for Nwon-knu to take Ret-sam's class.
Ret-sam is a very interesting creature.
Nobody knows how old Ret-sam is.
Somebody said that Ret-sam is as old as the Ian world.
That's impossible to think about!
20 billion cycles ago? Or, should I say 10100 giga cycles ago?
Nwon-knu is only 8 million cycles old, which makes Ret-sam 2500 times older than them.

"Nwon-knu, would you please introduce yourself to the class?" Ret-sam asked
That warm voice just pulled Nwon-knu from their thoughts back to reality.
"Oh, yes. Uh...Hi everyone, hmm... my name is Nwon-knu. and ... you can call me NK" Nwon-knu nervously said
"NK, relax, welcome to join this big family, please tell us what you like." Ret-sam calmed Nwon-knu and encouraged them to say more.
"Uh ..., you know, ... I am pretty good at math, I can do 'shift' in just one cycle __" Nwon-knu continued.
"Great. please sit down NK. We will do 'show and tell' another time." Ret-sam interrupted Nwon-knu and invited them to join the class and sit down.
It seems like Ret-sam doesn't want Nwon-knu talk more about the "shift"
