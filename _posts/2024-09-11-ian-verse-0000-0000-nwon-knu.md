Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. -- James

Nwon-knu grew to a full term of 7 million cycles, today is Nwon-knu's happiest day in their life.
Why? Nwon-knu heard about some subject called "geometry".
It claims to be the only science class rumored to give a glimpse of the mystery outer world.
Only mature enough Ianians can take such classes.
And, today it's Nwon-knu's day to be enrolled into the class.
Math is their favorite class.
```

Nwon-knu is born with the instinct of counting.
However, Ianians count in a very different way from humans.
They counted by 0 and 1.
We count like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and they count like  0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111.
Nobody knows when it started in that way or why, but they always counted in 1s and 0s.
So, to be exact, it's not 7 million cycles, it's actually 111 with 20 zeros after.
```

---

```
We say thousands with 3 zeros, they say kilo with 10 zeros.
We say millions with 6 zeros, they say mega with 20 zeros.
We say billions with 9 zeros, they say giga with 30 zeros.
We say trillions with 12 zeros, they say tera with 40 zeros.
```

---

```
So, Nwon-knu actually just finished a full term of "11,100,000,000,000,000,000,000" cycles.
We counted 7,340,032 on the earth.
For readers like us, it's too complicated to remember
Let's just use their terms, say 111 mega cycles, or 7 million cycles in our terms
```

---

```
To Nwon-knu, counting by 1s and 0s is their nature.
The first word out of Nwon-knu's mouth is 0, instead of Mom.
And the second word out of their mouth is 1, instead of Dad.
```

---

```
Before Nwon-knu be able to write their own name,
which is using the 256 characters
They can count naturally, and fast, very fast.
```

```
Nwon-knu can count at least 1 number in one cycle.
So, in the very short span of 7 million cycles, 
They already counts to 7 millions, and never stopped a beat 
(actually, Nwon-Knu knew a beat can be skipped, which is called "freeze")
(I can imagine my heart would skip a beat when somebody yelled "freeze!")
```

```
Nwon-knu heard of a secret scroll that has everyone's age and birth time.
They understand there is an origin of time called 0.
Nobody knows what's before the time 0.
According to math, it should have been negative time or something.
But nobody told Nwon-knu what happened before time 0.
(Time 0 is actually 1970, January 1st in our time — or rather, our Earth date.)
(But what's an "earth date" to Nwon-knu anyway)
