# Excerpt

On the day of 20 billion, 24 million, 8 thousands and 26 cycles
The IAN world welcomes yet another new life
This new life came with a name called Nwon-knu
Nwon-knu grew like any other Ianians
and started to explore this new world

As the elders told Nwon-knu
there is an invisible world beyond this world,
A world no life has ever seen.

That world hides the answer of the origin of life in IAN
So, will you help Nwon-knu on this journey to find the answer?
