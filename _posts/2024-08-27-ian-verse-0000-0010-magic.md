In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with the Creator , and the Word was the Creator. -- John

Nwon-knu realized their difference at a very young age.

Nwon-knu can do some "magic", where their parents don't know how.

---

One time, when Nwon-knu was very young, like 5 million cycles ago, they found some precious javabeans.

They are super tasty, and forbidden to the kids.

The javabeans can get kids super high.

Some kids eat them, and hit a life-threatening overheat

(more or less like a fever in our world).

Guess what would happen if they overheat?

Well, they become "frozen"!

(Hmm, this world's physics is very strange, how come overheating will freeze somebody?)

---

From that on, adults are warning the kids to leave the javabeans alone.

One day, a group of bullies robbed Nwon-knu of all their beans.

Nwon-knu was so upset and crying in the corner.

When Nwon-knu is reaching for his pocket for the tissue paper,

at the corner of the pocket there is one tiny round object hidden there.

---

Nwon-knu discovered the last javabean.

Nwon-knu said to themselves: "I wish I could have more"

---

"Shift" a small voice popped in Nwon-knu's ears.

​​Nwon-knu is astonished and looks around, there is nobody around.

"Shift to the left" the small voice says again.

"Shift to the left?" Nwon-knu repeated in doubt, while looking at the bean.

---

Pow! the beans multiplied into 2.

"Shift to the left!" Nwon-knu is excited, and says the magical words again.

Pow! the 2 beans multiplied into 4.

"Shift to the left! To the left!" Nwon-knu is yelling at top of their tiny lungs

"...!" 

Nwon-knu is frozen!

Nwon-knu is overheated!
