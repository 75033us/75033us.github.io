For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. -- The Redeemer

"Good morning, teacher!" As class all raise and greeting the teacher in harmony

"Morning, anybody want to share their dreams?" Ret-sam asked curiously.

​​"Me, me, pick me" the blue hairs raised their hands high to get attention.

"Sure Raih-leub, go head" Ret-sam nodded at them

---

"Here it is. a circle" Raih-leub closed their eyes, an array of 9x9 appeared

It's the same circle as teacher did yesterday

"That's great!" Ret-sam confirmed

---

"Hold on!" Raih-leub is not done yet.

The 9x9 started duplicating into 18x18 36x36 72x72...

"What?" Nwon-knu cannot believe their eyes

"That's the power of shifting" Nwon-knu said to themselves in their own mind.

---

The unfolded arrays floating around

Breaking into separate sequences

And connected together as a giant array of 144x144.

The giant circle slowly appeared using 1s among all the 0s.

The circle is too big, it covered the entire classroom.

---

"Wow!" "Ah!" all the classmates are impressed by this high resolution circle

Nobody noticed, Raih-leub blue hair floating out, as if charged by statics

The color changed from blue to dark blue to purple.

---

Seeing that, the teacher Ret-sam's eyebrows raised.

"That's perfect! That's enough." Ret-sam said.

---

But Raih-leub kept their eyes closed and didn't hear that.

the gain array is slowing rotating in the 2d array

floating over the entire classroom

and the array duplicating again into 288x288

the classroom can no longer hold the array

the elements started floating outside the windows

the big array actually floating over the entire campus

---

the day is darkened

the floating 2d arrays tuned from transparent 0s into black 0s

the sun light is blocked by the array

"No stop!" Ret-sam rushed and reach out to interrupt Raih-leub

---

the centerpiece of the circle

the 1s over there started getting bigger and darker

---

people say, that looks like a giant eye

others say, that looks like a giant portal

---

Ret-sam gets hold of Raih-leub's hands and brings them back.

Raih-leub collapsed and the giant portal/eye disappeared

day is back to light

---

everybody seems didn't noticed what happened

actually everybody was "frozen" at that moment

except Nwon-knu and Ret-sam

---

As if the day never darkened

As if the portal/eye never opened
