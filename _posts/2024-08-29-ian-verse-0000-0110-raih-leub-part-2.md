Ret-sam put Raih-leub back to their seats and looked at Nwon-knu

"Please take care of Raih-leub"

---

Time is back to normal

"Here it is. a circle" Raih-leub closed their eyes, an array of 9x9 appeared

Just back to the moment the 9x9 array appeared

nobody noticed anything wrong in the classroom

---

Ret-sam, "Isn't that a great demo? Now, let me tell you a few things about the circle!

Circle is one of the most magical shape in geometry

It's a very advanced shape

It's very unique

For fixed length of perimeter, circle has the largest area covered

As you have already know, every point on the circle has same distance to the center

You also know if you rotate the circle on the 2d surface, it kept the same shape

You never know if it rotated even though it kept rotating!"

"me - do - re - sol

sol - re - mi - do"

---

As if the class just started, it's ended.

"Nwon-knu, please take care of Raih-leub

Tomorrow, come to my office" Ret-sam talked to Nwon-knu after class

"Sure teacher!" Nwon-knu

--- 

Outside the classroom

Raih-leub still in Nwon-knu arms

Just as Ret-sam left the sight

Raih-leub jumped out of Nwon-knu arms

---

"You ok?"

"Yeah, I am better than ever!"

"I want to show you something"

Nwon-knu pulled Raih-leub and run to the back of the education building among the woods

Nwon-knu picked a small stone in his hand

"Shift to the left" the 1 small stone grew into 2 pieces

---

Raih-leub seems not impressed at all

"You do see I can do the same with the circles, right"? they asked

"Yeah, I noticed the teacher noticed me and you, but all the other students seem to remember nothing." Nwon-knu replied

"Right, because we are the chosen ones"

"Chosen ones"? Nwon-knu, this is first time they heard of such term

---

"You do read the news this morning, right?" Raih-leub switched the topic

"um-hum. It's strange. Death should never happen in Ian-verse. I never heard or read about anybody who died" NK replied seriously.

"Then how do you know the concept of death?" Raih-leub blinked their beautiful blue eyes and looked at NK.

"I know, I do know, I don't know why I know, but I do know..." NK tried to remember

"Maybe you saw death in some of your dreams" Raih-leub seems like an all-knowing person.

"Anyway, back to the news, don't you feel strange about the death? Do you want to check it out"?

---

"That's my plan. I am afraid I won't be able to do it because I need to take care of you." NK complained

"Why wait, let's go. I know how to get to ShalS" The blue hairs have already disappeared around the corner.

"Wait for me!" NK quickly followed
